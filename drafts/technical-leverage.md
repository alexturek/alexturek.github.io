# Guide to increasing technical leverage
What is the the code/systems equivalent of [Donna Meadows' _Leverage Points_ essay](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)?

"Broadcast" here means write a doc, give a talk, or some combo

## Good code
* Write the code
* Write the code + send out PR
* Do PRs
* Add linting rules (sometimes)
* Broadcast: how to write good code
* Broadcast: what makes code good?

## Good systems
* Do a full boxes-and-lines diagram, upfront design (also: good luck with that)
* Write a design doc
* Write the critical problems a good design will have for this system
* Broadcast principles of good architecture
