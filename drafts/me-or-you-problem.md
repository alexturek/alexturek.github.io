From conversation today:

* Caveat: cis straight white dude in tech. there's better advice for people who might be experiencing racism, sexism, transphobia, etc (LINKS)

* A situation's fucked up. Somebody is mad/disappointed at someone else. How do you know if it's a you or them problem?
  * "Describe what the camera would see" (SBI: B
  * Context of situation (SBI: S)
  * Who has more knowledge? Who has more power? Who should be responsible for a thing going well?
  * If you were to go back and change one thing to make the situation, would it be your behavior or theirs?
  * Are expectations reasonable? Were they communicated ahead of time?
  * You aren't responsible for other peoples' emotions
  * Who said what? Keep notes, write things down. Easier to distance yourself and understand (SBI: SB)

# Is this a me problem, or a them problem?

I've found myself in a lot of conflicts in my life, both professionally and personally. I always end up trying to understand "is this a me problem or a them problem?" before I know what to do. This essay has some strategies on how to answer that question.

## A history of conflict

Here are some examples of conflicts I've had from past jobs:

EXAMPLES

- People I've mentored, and it hasn't gone well (Convoy)
- Peers I've had conflicts with (Amazon, Ombitron)
- Managers (Amazon, Convoy)

## Conflict sequence

All these situations follow a rough sequence.

1. There's some sort of disagreement, or outright argument.
2. I'm upset: some combo of sad, angry, guilty feeling, or afraid. Fight-or-flight reactions might happen, or other physiological responses to conflict.
3. After I can calm down, I work to figure out who's (most) right: me or them?
4. I develop a plan what I'm going to do, now that I understand (3).

Understanding whose problem this is **isn't about assigning blame**.
There's no Universal Blame score we're all trying to optimize for.
What matters is understanding how to make my future better, specifically how to avoid the next iteration of this same conflict.

Conflicts tend to recur.
You can delay them with avoiding specific people, or specific situations with specific people, but constantly staying on your guard is exhausting.
Better answers are to either (1) address some of the contributing causes and stop the conflict repeating, or (2) prepare a strategy to deal with the conflict in the future.
Both of those require clear-headed analysis.

# Distance yourself from the situation

## Describe what a camera would see
## Pull in a third party
## Find reference points
## Write things down
# Framing the problem

## Power dynamics
## Participant backgrounds

# Separating responsibilities: problem vs solution
