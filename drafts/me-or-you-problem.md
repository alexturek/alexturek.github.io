From conversation today:

* A situation's fucked up. Somebody is mad/disappointed at someone else. How do you know if it's a you or them problem?
  * "Describe what the camera would see" (SBI: B)
  * Context of situation (SBI: S)
  * Who has more knowledge? Who has more power? Who should be responsible for a thing going well?
  * If you were to go back and change one thing to make the situation, would it be your behavior or theirs?
  * Are expectations reasonable? Were they communicated ahead of time?
  * You aren't responsible for other peoples' emotions
  * Who said what? Keep notes, write things down. Easier to distance yourself and understand (SBI: SB)
