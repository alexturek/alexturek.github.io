title: Effective code review conversations
---

# Having good code reviews
These are the explicit goals of a code review. These shouldn't be controversial; they're what virtually 100% of software engineers would agree with.

1. Defect-free code
2. Clear code
3. Ship the feature or bugfix

But there are other implicit goals of a code review; these are determined by the approach the reviewers and submitter take into it.

# Approach 1: Argue about the code
### Secondary goals
1. Make all code exactly the way you would have written it.
2. Feel smarter than others.

### What it looks like
1. Artifacts get attributed to a person (e.g. `Your code`, `Your comment`). [2]
2. Comments and feedback use zero-sum languge (e.g. `I concede`, `You win`, `You're wrong`).
3. Somebody keeps repeating their argument in different ways.
4. Follow-on commenters de-escalate the conversation.
5. Generalization - `never do X`, `always do Y`
6. Criticism without clear alternatives. (`Please make this clearer`)

### What it feels like
1. You feel attacked by comments or responses.
2. You dislike submitting PRs, or being asked to review them, because they make you mad.
3. You feel like your code has been mangled, or your opinion has been dismissed as irrelevant.

# Approach 2: Conversation
### Secondary goals
1. Make code some happy medium of clear, for all future readers.
2. Learn something.

### What it looks like
1. Almost every comment is a question (e.g. `Why use...`, `How does this work?`)
2. People use happy emojis. üëç and üòÑ
3. Most conversations are short - either the fix is obvious and accepted, or the commenter is happy with the submitter's response.
4. There are specific code examples, especially for proposed refactors.
5. Nobody is always right, or always wrong. In a long PR, there might be 90% accepted comments, and a few that all parties agree to disregard.

### What it feels like
1. Comments make you happy, because they're a chance to clean up your code.
2. You feel like you learn something after submitting or reviewing a pull request.
3. When the PR merges, you feel ownership over the code.
