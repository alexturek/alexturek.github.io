Talk about profiles of complaints (or complainers?) using a funnel model

Some ideas for archetypes:
* Builder (falls off after 4 but not all the way)
* Malcontent (falls off after 2)
* Martyr (never falls off, burns out)
* Delegator, but a funnier word that makes fun of them, for people who fall off 100% after 4.
* Sam (0% falloff 2-3)
* Prioritizer (falls off heavily 1-2, low falloff afterward)


# Funnel
1. I see there's a problem
2. I say "there's a problem!"
3. I understand enough to give context on the problem (impact, causes)
4. I can describe a solution
5. I'm gonna solve it

People who fall off heavily mainly at 2-3 are the people who are a huge energy sink.
They constantly point out problems with no followthrough even on context
Obviously everyone _should_ fall off 4-5 because your personal bandwidth is limited
You want minimal fall-off through 2-3-4
